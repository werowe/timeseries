This Jupyter notebook loads and processes weather time series data, prepares it for deep learning, trains an LSTM neural network to forecast future temperatures, and evaluates forecast accuracy for validation and test sets.

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### 1. **Data Loading and Preparation**
- Reads a CSV of weather observations, selecting columns: datetime, temperature, humidity, precipitation, sea-level pressure, and cloud cover.
- Extracts the `datetime` column separately and drops it from the DataFrame to leave only the numeric weather variables.

#### 2. **Exploration and Conversion**
- Shows a data sample: the resulting DataFrame is 32,911 rows Ã— 5 columns, containing the main weather metrics.
- Converts the DataFrame to a NumPy array (`raw_data`) for efficient numerical processing.

#### 3. **Missing Value Check**
- Uses NumPy to check for NaN values in `raw_data`; results show none are present.

#### 4. **Train/Validation/Test Split**
- Splits the data into training (50%), validation (25%), and test (25%) sets for machine learning model development and fair evaluation.

#### 5. **Normalization**
- Normalizes (standardizes) features using the mean and standard deviation from the training set, which is important for neural network performance.

#### 6. **Time Series Dataset Generation**
- Uses Keras `timeseries_dataset_from_array` to construct datasets of input sequences for supervised learning.
  - Each sample is a window of 120 time steps (hourly data, ~5 days).
  - The target is a temperature value for a delayed future time.

#### 7. **Naive Forecast Evaluation**
- Implements a simple baseline model ("naive method"): forecasts future temperature by echoing the last value in the input window, evaluates performance with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for validation and test sets.

#### 8. **Training LSTM Network**
- Builds an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network with Keras to learn patterns in the input weather sequences and predict future temperature.
- Trains the network for 10 epochs, saving the best model using validation MAE.
